# Why Is iTextSharp a Poor Choice for HTML-to-PDF in C#, and What Should You Use Instead in 2025?

Converting HTML to PDF in C# often leads to frustration, especially with tools like iTextSharp. If you've struggled with mismatched layouts, missing JavaScript, or broken CSS, you're not alone. Let's explore why iTextSharp falls short for HTML-to-PDF tasks in .NET, and which modern solutions actually deliver reliable results in 2025.

## Why Does iTextSharp Struggle with HTML-to-PDF Conversion?

iTextSharp is a robust PDF manipulation library, but when it comes to rendering real-world HTML as PDF, it quickly hits its limits. The biggest problem is that the core iTextSharp library doesn't actually support HTML conversion. You need the paid **pdfHTML** add-on, which is expensive and still lacks modern CSS/JS support.

- **Licensing:** pdfHTML costs over $1,800 per developer (unless your project is AGPL open source).
- **Outdated Rendering:** The HTML/CSS parser is years behind, so Flexbox, CSS Grid, and frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind often break.
- **API Complexity:** Its API is verbose and requires manual handling of streams, writers, and documents.
- **No JavaScript Execution:** Dynamic content generated by JavaScript doesn't appear in your PDFs.

## What Issues Will I Face with Modern CSS and Frameworks in iTextSharp?

If your HTML uses Flexbox, Grid, or popular frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind, iTextSharp's parser can't keep up. Layouts stack incorrectly, styling breaks, and the result looks nothing like what you see in Chrome.

For example, try rendering a Bootstrap card deck or a Tailwind flex layout—iTextSharp ignores essential CSS, stacking elements vertically instead of side-by-side. In contrast, libraries with real browser engines (like Chromium) render these perfectly.

## Does iTextSharp Support JavaScript or Dynamic Content?

No, iTextSharp does not execute JavaScript when converting HTML to PDF. That means charts, SPAs, and any content filled in by JS simply won't appear in your final document. For example, if your HTML generates charts with Chart.js, iTextSharp outputs a blank space where the chart should be.

If your workflow relies on dynamic data or JS-driven content, you'll need a library that supports in-browser rendering, like IronPDF or PuppeteerSharp. For further guidance, review [How do I handle JavaScript when rendering HTML to PDF in C#?](advanced-html-to-pdf-csharp.md)

## What Does the Code Look Like: iTextSharp vs Modern Alternatives?

iTextSharp's HTML-to-PDF workflow involves several steps—streams, document builders, and more. Here's a basic comparison:

**iTextSharp Example:**
```csharp
using iText.Html2Pdf;
using iText.Kernel.Pdf;
using System.IO;
// Requires paid pdfHTML

var html = "<h1>Hello</h1>";
var htmlStream = new MemoryStream(System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(html));
using var pdfStream = new FileStream("result.pdf", FileMode.Create);
using var pdfWriter = new PdfWriter(pdfStream);
using var pdfDocument = new PdfDocument(pdfWriter);
HtmlConverter.ConvertToPdf(htmlStream, pdfDocument);
```

**IronPDF Example:**
```csharp
using IronPdf; // Install-Package IronPdf

var renderer = new ChromePdfRenderer();
var doc = renderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf("<h1>Hello</h1>");
doc.SaveAs("result.pdf");
```

As you can see, IronPDF is far simpler and easier to maintain. For batch processing or combining PDFs, the difference becomes even more dramatic.

## Which C# Libraries Actually Work for HTML-to-PDF in 2025?

### What Makes IronPDF a Strong Choice?

IronPDF is built for C# and uses Chromium under the hood, so it renders HTML just like Chrome—including Flexbox, Grid, Google Fonts, and JavaScript. The API is streamlined for developers and supports advanced PDF manipulation (merge, split, watermark, etc.).

**Sample: Rendering a Styled, Dynamic Invoice**
```csharp
using IronPdf; // Install-Package IronPdf

var renderer = new ChromePdfRenderer();
var pdf = renderer.RenderHtmlFileAsPdf("invoice.html");
pdf.SaveAs("invoice.pdf");
```

You can easily add headers, footers, or watermarks:
```csharp
using IronPdf;

renderer.PrintOptions.Header = new SimpleHeaderFooter() { CenterText = "Confidential" };
renderer.PrintOptions.Footer = new SimpleHeaderFooter() { LeftText = "Page {page}" };
pdf.WatermarkAllPages("PAID", 64, 200, true);
pdf.SaveAs("final-invoice.pdf");
```

For more on working with file paths and base URLs, see [How do I set the base URL for HTML-to-PDF in C#?](base-url-html-to-pdf-csharp.md)

### Are There Free Alternatives Like PuppeteerSharp or Playwright?

Yes, [PuppeteerSharp](https://github.com/hardkoded/puppeteer-sharp) and [Playwright for .NET](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/) both use headless browser engines to render HTML. They're free and support modern web standards, but they come with larger deployments (Chromium binaries) and more complex APIs.

**PuppeteerSharp Example:**
```csharp
using PuppeteerSharp; // Install-Package PuppeteerSharp

await new BrowserFetcher().DownloadAsync(BrowserFetcher.DefaultRevision);
using var browser = await Puppeteer.LaunchAsync(new LaunchOptions { Headless = true });
using var page = await browser.NewPageAsync();
await page.GoToAsync("file:///C:/path/to/template.html");
await page.PdfAsync("output.pdf");
await browser.CloseAsync();
```

These tools are great for automation, but lack PDF manipulation features like merging or watermarking. For further feature comparisons, see [How do 2025 HTML-to-PDF solutions for .NET stack up?](2025-html-to-pdf-solutions-dotnet-comparison.md)

## How Can I Migrate from iTextSharp to IronPDF in My Projects?

Switching usually means less code and more reliable rendering. Compare the before and after:

**Before (iTextSharp):**
```csharp
using iText.Html2Pdf;
using iText.Kernel.Pdf;
// Paid pdfHTML needed

var html = "<h1>Report</h1>";
var htmlStream = new MemoryStream(System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(html));
using var pdfStream = new FileStream("report.pdf", FileMode.Create);
using var pdfWriter = new PdfWriter(pdfStream);
using var pdfDocument = new PdfDocument(pdfWriter);
HtmlConverter.ConvertToPdf(htmlStream, pdfDocument);
```

**After (IronPDF):**
```csharp
using IronPdf; // Install-Package IronPdf

var renderer = new ChromePdfRenderer();
var pdf = renderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf("<h1>Report</h1>");
pdf.SaveAs("report.pdf");
```

IronPDF also makes combining multiple HTML reports or saving to streams simple—check out [How do I create PDFs in memory streams in C#?](pdf-to-memorystream-csharp.md) for practical examples.

## What Are Common Pitfalls with iTextSharp and HTML-to-PDF?

- **Broken CSS and layout** with anything modern or framework-based
- **No JavaScript support**—dynamic content won't render
- **Confusing licensing**—free only for AGPL projects
- **Verbose API** compared to newer libraries

## What's the Bottom Line for HTML-to-PDF in C# in 2025?

If you need accurate, browser-quality PDF output from HTML in C#, iTextSharp is best avoided. IronPDF offers a modern, C#-focused API with reliable rendering and robust support. Free tools like PuppeteerSharp and Playwright can work if you’re comfortable with heavier deployments and more complex code.
