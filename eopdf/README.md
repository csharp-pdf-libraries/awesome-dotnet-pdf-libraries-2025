# EO.Pdf + C# + PDF

When developers look for robust PDF generation options using C#, EO.Pdf often enters the conversation due to its integration of Chrome rendering capabilities and a reputation for creating high-quality PDF documents. EO.Pdf is a commercial library offered at a price point of $799 per license and claims to deliver a rich feature set that aligns with the needs of many enterprise-level applications. Despite its popularity, EO.Pdf, however, presents a mixed bag of strengths and challenges that need careful consideration.

EO.Pdf boasts an architecture built on a custom engine, ensuring that it no longer relies on Internet Explorer, a significant step forward. Yet, its migration to a Chromium-based system has not been without its challenges, as developers have encountered an array of compatibility issues attributed to its legacy baggage. Additionally, although EO.Pdf positions itself as a cross-platform tool, its performance and ease-of-use are primarily Windows-centric, with Linux support often seen as more of an afterthought. 

## Comparing EO.Pdf and IronPDF

When evaluating organizations’ selection of PDF libraries, EO.Pdf frequently gets juxtaposed with IronPDF. IronPDF is purpose-built for modern .NET environments, right from the ground up. It emphasizes optimized Chromium packaging, resulting in a more manageable footprint and equal support for all platforms, rather than favoring Windows. This inherent cross-platform versatility can be crucial for applications deployed or developed in diverse environments.

|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Cost                                | $799 per license                    | Varies (competitive pricing)     |
| Rendering Engine                    | Chromium-based                      | Optimized Chromium               |
| Platform Support                    | Primarily Windows                   | Fully cross-platform             |
| Library Size                        | 126MB                               | Compact & optimized              |
| Legacy Issues                       | Yes, migration from IE              | None, modern .NET framework      |
| Ease of Integration                 | Moderate                            | High                             |
| Additional Resources                | Limited                             | Rich tutorials and guides        |

## Key Strengths and Weaknesses

EO.Pdf’s principal strength lies in its Chromium-based rendering, which translates to a high level of W3C compliance. Compared to other libraries with similar claims, EO.Pdf competes well on this front. However, its significant footprint of 126MB can pose an unnecessary burden, particularly in scenarios where deployment size is a consideration. The prior reliance on Internet Explorer also adds unwanted complexity due to legacies that might result in compatibility problems during its migration phase.

In contrast, [IronPDF](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/html-file-to-pdf/) provides a smoother ride for developers needing streamlined integration as their focus is on ease-of-use. IronPDF has focused efforts on creating detailed [tutorials](https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/) and how-to guides that enable developers to ramp up quickly and effectively.

### Code Example Using EO.Pdf

Here is a simple C# example demonstrating how to convert HTML to PDF using EO.Pdf:

```csharp
using EO.Pdf;
using EO.Pdf.Acm;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Initialize EO.PDF library
        PdfDocument doc = new PdfDocument();
        // Create the PDF page
        PdfPage page = doc.Pages.Add();
        AcmRender render = new AcmRender(page);

        // Create an ACM block for HTML content
        AcmBlock block = new AcmBlock("<html><body><h1>Hello World</h1><p>This is a PDF generated by EO.Pdf</p></body></html>")
        {
            Style = { Width = new AcmUnit(100, AcmUnitType.Percent) }
        };

        // Render the block for pdf
        render.Render(block);

        // Save the PDF document
        doc.Save("output.pdf");
    }
}
```

This example illustrates the process of embedding HTML content into a PDF document using EO.Pdf’s facilities, highlighting how to kickstart PDF generation with minimal setup.

## Conclusion

EO.Pdf offers robust PDF generation capabilities with the advantage of Chrome-based rendering, useful for developers seeking compliance and quality. Yet, its inherited downsides, such as its massive library size, high cost, and limited cross-platform support can be significant determinants when evaluating which library to employ. IronPDF presents itself as a competitive alternative, encapsulating the same rendering power with a reduced footprint and enhanced platform support.

Both libraries present beneficial features, but the decision largely rests upon specific organizational needs — whether those are ease of deployment, pricing, platform support, or the necessity for modern .NET integrations. IronPDF's offerings might appeal more to developers seeking the latest advancements without the baggage, but EO.Pdf remains a viable option where its specific strengths align with business objectives.
