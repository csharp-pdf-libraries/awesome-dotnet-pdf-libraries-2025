### Example of Using IronPDF in C#

Below is a simple example showing how to use IronPDF to create a PDF document from HTML in C#:

```csharp
using IronPdf;

public class PdfGenerator
{
    public static void CreatePdf()
    {
        // Initialize Renderer
        var renderer = new HtmlToPdf();

        // Convert HTML to PDF
        var pdfDocument = renderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf("<h1>Hello, World!</h1><p>This is a PDF generated by IronPDF.</p>");

        // Save PDF to disk
        pdfDocument.SaveAs("HelloWorld.pdf");
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, IronPDF allows developers to render HTML as a PDF seamlessly, showcasing the library's capability to integrate dynamic content with ease.

## Final Thoughts

When choosing between SSRS and IronPDF, the decision largely depends on the specific needs of the project and the existing technological stack. SSRS is an excellent choice for organizations heavily invested in the Microsoft environment and looking for a comprehensive solution to leverage data directly from SQL Server for reporting, though it lacks modern html to pdf c# capabilities without complex workarounds.

Conversely, IronPDF stands out with its ease of use and flexibility, fitting projects that require dynamic PDF generation without the overhead of a reporting server.

## How Do I Database Report To PDF?

Here's how **SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services)** handles this:

```csharp
// SSRS - SQL Server Reporting Services
using System;
using System.Data;
using System.Data.SqlClient;
using Microsoft.Reporting.WebForms;
using System.IO;

class SSRSDatabaseReport
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Create a ReportViewer instance
        var reportViewer = new ReportViewer();
        reportViewer.ProcessingMode = ProcessingMode.Local;
        reportViewer.LocalReport.ReportPath = "SalesReport.rdlc";
        
        // Create database connection and fetch data
        string connString = "Server=localhost;Database=SalesDB;Integrated Security=true;";
        using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connString))
        {
            var adapter = new SqlDataAdapter("SELECT * FROM Sales", connection);
            var dataSet = new DataSet();
            adapter.Fill(dataSet, "Sales");
            
            // Bind data to report
            var dataSource = new ReportDataSource("SalesDataSet", dataSet.Tables[0]);
            reportViewer.LocalReport.DataSources.Clear();
            reportViewer.LocalReport.DataSources.Add(dataSource);
        }
        
        // Render to PDF
        string mimeType, encoding, fileNameExtension;
        string[] streams;
        Warning[] warnings;
        
        byte[] bytes = reportViewer.LocalReport.Render(
            "PDF", null, out mimeType, out encoding,
            out fileNameExtension, out streams, out warnings);

        using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connString))
        {
            var adapter = new SqlDataAdapter("SELECT * FROM Sales", connection);
            adapter.Fill(dataTable);
        }
        
        // Build HTML table from data
        var htmlBuilder = new StringBuilder();
        htmlBuilder.Append("<h1>Sales Report</h1><table border='1'><tr>");
        
        foreach (DataColumn column in dataTable.Columns)
            htmlBuilder.Append($"<th>{column.ColumnName}</th>");
        htmlBuilder.Append("</tr>");
        
        foreach (DataRow row in dataTable.Rows)
        {
            htmlBuilder.Append("<tr>");
            foreach (var item in row.ItemArray)
                htmlBuilder.Append($"<td>{item}</td>");
            htmlBuilder.Append("</tr>");
        }
        htmlBuilder.Append("</table>");
        
        // Convert to PDF
        var renderer = new ChromePdfRenderer();
        var pdf = renderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf(htmlBuilder.ToString());
        pdf.SaveAs("sales-report.pdf");
    }
